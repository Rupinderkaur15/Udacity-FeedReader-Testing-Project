<h3>Udacity FeedReader Testing Project</h3>
Made By : Rupinder Kaur.


In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.<br>
The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine] and even started writing their first test suite!<br>Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. <br>That's where I come in.


<h3>Getting Started</h3><br>
<h4>Tests<h4>
<br>
<strong>RSS Feeds:</strong>
<br>
1-Test feeds are defined<br>
2-Test feed URLs are defined and contain content<br>
3-Test feed names are defined and contain content<br>
<br>
<strong>Menu:</strong>

1-Test is hidden on page load<br>
2-Test menu icon appears on click<br>
<br>
<strong>First RSS Entry:</strong>

1-Test at least one entry displays on load after async call<br>
<strong>RSS Entry Change:</strong><br>
1-Test RSS entry changes on menu select<br>

<strong>##Sources:</strong>
To run the application: download the github repo from https://github.com/Rupinderkaur15/Udacity-FeedReader-Testing-Project and then open index.html in your browser.<br>
The jasmine tests will automatically run and will appear at the bottom of the page.<br>
The file for the jasmine tests are located in jasmine/spec/feedreader.js.
